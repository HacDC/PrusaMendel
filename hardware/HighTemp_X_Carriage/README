High-Temperature Fiberboard X-Carriage, intended for manufacture by CNC Milling.

In use at HacDC as of January 19, 2014.

Not directly recommended for new designs. Rather, it would be advisable to export a 2D only drawing, skipping the 3D G-Code generation toolset. From there, most wide-area CNC machines, including laser cutters, should be able to manufacture the part.
