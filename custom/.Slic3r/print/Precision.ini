notes = Higher resolution and improved surfaces. Specifically intended for small parts with small features. Also a good starting place for debugging print errors.\n\nUses more, thinner layers, slower X/Y moves, and rapid acceleration.\n\nMaximum print speed is the lesser of 115mm/s or 11.25/layer_height. Exceeding these limits will incurr excessive stress on the printer.
